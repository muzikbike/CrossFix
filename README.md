# CrossFix
This resource pack tweaks the models of blocks with cross-shaped elements to make more sense.
Currently in vanilla, texture planes of these crosses exhibit slightly unrealistic behavior, as a physical feature on one side of a plane may not exist at all on the other side.
This is also a parity fix, as texture planes behave as expected on Bedrock Edition.
However, fixing this has the potentially unwanted side effect of making blocks appear extremely odd from some angles - as such, players may wish to not have this fix.
